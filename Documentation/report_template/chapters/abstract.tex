Capture-The-Flag challenges are one of the most recognized ways to prove anyone's skills and expertise in a specific cybersecirity-related topic.
This type of event is usually executed as a contest between different individuals or teams, such that a given system has to be analyzed and/or interacted with in order to uncover its well-hidden secrets and master its range of capabilities.

The type of CTF competition which will be hereby discussed pertains the hardware sphere, and it consists in finding a concealed vulnerability inside a Block Cipher written in VHDL.
Users can actually interact with a real board and test its functionality by connecting to the challenge itself inside any standard browser, with the final objective of recognizing the intended asset.
